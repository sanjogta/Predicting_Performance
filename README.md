# Predicting_Student_Performance (Supervised Learning, classification Problem)

### This is a problem in the Kaggle competetion. I've tried predicting student performance using Scikit Learn's DecisionTreeClassifier model.
### Using the DecisionTreeClassifier, I'm able to get an average accyraacy of 65.84% on the validation set.
### I have performed the below steps on the data:
#### 1. Exploring the dataset
#### 2. re-assigning the datatype to reduce memory usage
#### 3. Preprocessing the dataset
#### 4. Training 18 models for each question
#### 5. Computing average accuracy
#### 6. Making predictions on test set
